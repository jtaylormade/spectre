title: Quantum Control of Rydberg Atoms for Mesoscopic Quantum State and Circuit Preparation
date: 08-18-2025
description: Individually trapped Rydberg atoms offer a versatile platform for scalable quantum simulation and computation.  This paper demonstrates high-fidelity state and circuit preparation in a five-atom system using quantum control techniques and the Rydberg-blockade effect.  The approach enables reliable generation of fully connected cluster states and implementation of an error-correction encoding circuit, highlighting the noise tolerance of the method.
