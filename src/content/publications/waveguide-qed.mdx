title: Waveguideâ€‘QED platform for synthetic quantum matter
date: 08-18-2025
description: This work proposes a hybrid nanophotonic system in which cold atoms interact with photonic crystal waveguides to create analog quantum matter.  Phononic superfluids mediate interactions that realise universal 2-local Hamiltonians, enabling the synthesis of complex quantum materials.  The authors also introduce a toolkit for mapping conformal field-theory data to photon correlators, paving the way for exploring dynamical gauge fields and emergent SU(n) lattice models.
