title: Assessing quantum dot SWAP gate fidelity using tensor network methods
date: 08-18-2025
description: Using advanced tensor-network numerics, this study investigates the fidelity of repeated SWAP operations on long chains of quantum-dot spin qubits subject to valley leakage and electrostatic crosstalk.  The authors find that gate fidelity is largely insensitive to Zeeman and valley splitting except at resonance, while crosstalk emerges as the dominant source of error in extended qubit chains.
